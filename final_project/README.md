*Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express | Coursera | Final Project*

For my final project in the IBM Backend Development with Node.js and Express.js certification course on Coursera, I developed a robust backend application by systematically completing the provided tasks. This project showcases my proficiency in creating server-side applications using Node.js and Express.js. Throughout the course, I implemented RESTful APIs, handled middleware, and ensured efficient data handling and security. The hands-on tasks from Coursera guided me in building a fully functional backend, demonstrating my capability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios in backend development.
